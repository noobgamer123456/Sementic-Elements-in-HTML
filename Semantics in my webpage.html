          <h2>About Valorant</h2>
          <p>
            Valorant is a 5v5 tactical shooter game developed by Riot Games.
            Released in 2020, it quickly gained popularity for its unique blend
            of strategic gameplay and diverse cast of agents, each with their
            own abilities. Players must work together to plant or defuse the
            Spike while mastering their agent's abilities and aiming precision.
            The game emphasizes teamwork, strategy, and mechanical skill, making
            it one of the most competitive shooters today.

            Did you know that Valorant features agents from various backgrounds,
            each representing a different country? For example, Jett hails from
            South Korea, while Phoenix is from the UK. Each agent brings a
            distinct playstyle, ranging from duelists like Reyna to strategists
            like Viper. Choose wisely to complement your team!
